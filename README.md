# SCP:CB Short Guide
A guide to beating SCP: Containment Breach.


## Light Containment Zone
You start in this area of the game.

### Hostile SCPS
- SCP-173 (Peanut)
  - This is the first enemy that you encounter at the start of the game.  When you encounter this, you must keep eye contact or it will kill you.  It moves when you blink and is very fast.
- SCP-079 (Computer)
  - The computer can be found in the entrance zone, but it has control of the facility and can close the doors in front of you.  It can also display images from SCP-895 which will kill the player if they look at them.
- SCP-106 (Old Man/Larry) (After a while)
  - 106 is capable of travelling through walls.  If you encounter this SCP, the only way to escape is by running as far away as you can or by using SCP-1499 to despawn him.  If he catches you: you'll be transported to his pocket dimension which often results in your death.
- SCP-049 (Plague Doctor)
  - This SCP will simply follow and kill you with a single touch.  It only appears when you disable the checkpoint lockdown.  To avoid dying, put on SCP-714 and keep moving.  He is able to remove the ring if you stand still.
- SCP-939 (Red Storage Beasts)
  - These SCPs are only found underground.  They are capable of making fake human speech to lure people in.  You'll know if one has spotted you.  The best tactic for these guys is to play it slowly and only run when you need to.
- SCP-1048-A (B-ear)
  - This is a small teddybear that can be found in the middle of a hallway in the Light Containment Zone.  If you approach it, it will let out a high pitched shriek that will kill the player.  It is very small and dark so keep an eye out.
- *SWITCH MECHANIC*
  - This is not an SCP but the game has a mechanic in which the player can turn 180 degrees on the spot in the hallways in the Light Containment Zone.  This can lead to your death if you are running away from something.  A sound que will occur when this happens.

### Objectives

## Other Notes
Some other useful tips.

### Dealing with Nine Tailed Fox
1. If SCP-173 has not been contained, bait it into NTF.  They will ignore you until they have temporarily contained it.  They will then bring it all the way back to spawn.
2. Bait them into SCP-049 or SCP-106, they will run away from them.
3. Hide from them while they pass.  You can also bait them and hide if you are passing through an area that they patrol.

### Exclaves
Sometimes, the map generation can screw up and put SCP-008's, SCP-106's or SCP-079's chambers into an exclave only accessible through Light Containment Zone.
