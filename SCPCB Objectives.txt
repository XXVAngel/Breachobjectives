HOW TO DEAL WITH EVERY SCP SUBJECTS:

SCP-049: PUT ON SCP-714 AND RUN, HE WILL REMOVE THE RING IF YOU STAND TOO LONG NEXT TO HI, HE WALKS SLOWLY BUT DO NOT GET CORNERED. AS OF PATCH 1.3.10, YOU CAN RUN IN CIRCLES TO KEEP HIM FROM TAKING SCP-714 OFF!

SCP-049-2: JUST WALK AROUND IT, MTF WILL KILL THEM ON SIGHT.

SCP-079: DOES NOT DIRECTLY ATTACK THE PLAYER. PUT ON SCP-714 IF IT OPEN THE DOORS TO SCP-012 AND LOOK AWAY IF THE COMPUTER SCREENS DISPLAY IMAGERY OF SCP-895!

SCP-096: DO NOT LOOK AT IT'S FACE, THAT THING IS ALMOST GUARANTIED DEATH, THE ONLY EXEPTION IS MAKING HIM RUN INTO A TESLA GATE AND RUNNING TO AN EXIT BUT IT'S NOT GUARANTIED TO WORK.

SCP-106: INSTANTLY DESPAWNS IF SCP-1499 IS USED, OTHERWISE TIME HIM OUT OR MAKING HIM RUN INTO A TESLA GATE! HIS TOUCH IS NOT INSTANT KILL!

SCP-173: MUST MAINTAIN EYE CONTACT, IT CANNOT OPEN DOORS, SO CLOSE THEM AND BAIT IT TO THE MTFS WHEN THEY APPEAR!

SCP-895: JUST DON'T GET IN IT'S CHAMBER. THERES NOTHING THERE! MONITORS KILL YOU!

SCP-939: THEY WALK IN CIRCLES BUT STOP IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE, WAIT UNTIL THE WAY IS CLEAR AND USE THEIR VOICE TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE!

SCP-966: USE THE NIGHT VISION GOGGLES TO SEE WHERE THEY ARE, WATCHOUT FOR DOORWAYS BECAUSE THEY LOVE TO BODYBLOCK THEM. THEY DO NOT DEAL ALOT OF DAMAGE BUT ENOGUH TO SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE OTHER SCPS TO KILL YOU!

SCP-1048-A: GET AWAY FROM THAT TEDDYBEAR LOOKIN ASS. HIS SHRIEK WILL KILL YOU IF YOU STAY TOO CLOSE FOR 20 SECONDS.
